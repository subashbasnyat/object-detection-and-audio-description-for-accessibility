# Real-Time Object Detection and Audio Description for Accessibility
This project aims to develop an offline, real-time web application to assist visually impaired users by detecting objects via webcam or uploaded images and providing audio descriptions. These descriptions are generated by an object detection model, formatted by a lightweight offline Large Language Model (LLM), and delivered through an offline Text-to-Speech (TTS) system.

Visually impaired individuals often face challenges in identifying objects and navigating their surroundings independently and safely. Real-time information about objects, potential obstacles, and environmental context can significantly enhance their mobility and awareness. Existing solutions may rely on cloud connectivity or lack the specific combination of real-time object detection with natural language audio descriptions in a fully offline capacity.
